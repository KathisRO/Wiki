**Endless Tower** (ET) is a dungeon instance situated in the middle of the ocean. Once surrounded by a thick fog, the Misty Island is now accessible to adventurers from the docks of [[Alberta]]. The dungeon is made up of 101 floors of increasingly difficult monsters, including [[MVP]]

*   The instance has a 4 hour time limit and will automatically close if all party members leave the tower for more than 5 minutes.
*    Each character may only attempt an Endless Tower instance once every 6 days.

Currently, there is an IP restriction on this instance. This prevents multiple users from the same household/network from playing together.

### Quest Steps

1. To get to the Misty Island, speak to **Captain Janssen** (alberta 214, 77) in southwest Alberta. He will ask you for 10,000 zeny for each boat ride.
2. The party leader generates the instance by talking to the **Tower Protection Stone** (e_tower 81,105).
3. Speak to the **Tower Protection Stone** (e_tower 81,105) to enter the instance.
4. Clear all the monsters on each floor to progress to the next. Note that if you have Ashes of Darkness, not all areas must be cleared in order for you to reach F100.
5. Defeat Entweihen Crothen on F100 to speak with the **Lucid Crystal** (5@tower 106,109) in the northeast corner. If it is your first time defeating Entweihen Crothen, you will be kicked from the tower because the Mysterious Voice does not deem you worthy yet.
6. Otherwise, you will be warped to Naght Sieger's throne room. He will spawn multiple sets of mobs before appearing himself.
7. Upon victory, a **Lost Soul** (6@tower,169,127) will appear. He will reward you with a Token of the Dead before sending you back to Alberta. See [[#Related Items]] for additional rewards.

### Mechanics
The following restrictions are in effect inside the tower:

* **Disabled Items**: Fly Wing
*    **Disabled Skills**: [[Ice Wall]], [[Leap]],[[Intimidate]], [[Teleport]]
*    Mobs, including MVPs, are unable to use Teleport.
*    MVPs are unable to recall slaves that are out of range. They will only re-summon when the number of slaves drops below a certain number.
