No one knows where the first goblin came from, but what is known is that they are made of magic. The goblins do not have a face, so they wear masks to see and speak. Upon their creation the goblin will be given a weapon that is suited to their elemental affiliation. The goblins have a tribal system and as such have a leader for each of their tribes. 

They are not that inteligent but have been known to mimic creatures that are bigger than them, hoping that the mimicing will help to defend themselves. 

No one knows when the goblins discovered they can channel wind energy into machines to grant them flight, but stories surmise that they saw the airships flying above their lands, and thought it was a great beast. Scared they tried to figure out how to fly like it, it's possible that a peice of an airship had fallen. Giving them an idea of how to progress. 

Goblins are very dangerious and one should not go unperpared.
