The Pungus family has an interesting cycle. 

Starting out as nothing but some dust, their bodies start to spread and convert the ground around them until their being can come into existance. 

# Cycle
During the entire Larval stage of the Pungus family, they are consider plants, and are considered poisonous.

Once the Pungus grows, they change from a plant type to a formless. Their element is considered wind, but they gain the ability to turn living matter into stone, if left the creature that is turned to stone will decay into dust that will create more Punks, and the cycle contiunes. 

## Larval 
The first step in the cycle is the [[Monsters/(1199)|(M/1199)]]. Punks are relativily weak, however their bodies give off spores that can cause those near to rot from within.  

The Punks reach adolescence after 3-4 years, turing into a [[Monsters/(1378)|(M/1378)]]. The Demon Pungus bodies will start to harden. It should be noted that if the area is too populated instead of hardening, the Demon Pungus will start to merge with each other, condensing their bodies and consciousness into a single entity known as [[Monsters/(2919)|(M/2919)]]. The Neo Punk is a dangerous creature and should not be taken lightly.  however such an occurance is extermly rare, since most pungus monsters want to spread out.

## Adult
After about 4 years the Demon Pungus bodies have hardened into a [[Monsters/(1633)|(M/1633)]]. The Beholder is very weak in this stage of their lives, and it will take them another year or two before they can grow and build up their bodies, when this happens they become what is known as a [[Monsters/1774|(M/1774)]]. The Seeker is much more stronger. Sometimes though rare the Seeker will not stop growing their bodies, and will turn into a [[Monsters/(1975)|(M/1975)]]. The Beholder Master is extermly dangerious, and should be only approach with caution.
