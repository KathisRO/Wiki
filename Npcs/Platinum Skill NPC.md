# Details

This is a service npc that allows characters to skip their platinum skill quest. However these skills are temporary. If the character does a skill reset, the platinum skills will be removed. 

This npc costs 1,000 zeny, and doesn't check to see if the character has the skills already. 

See the [[Mecahnics/Classes|Classes]] to know what the skills are.
